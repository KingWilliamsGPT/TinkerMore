# TinkerMore
TinkerMore Is a platform of many playgrounds to allow you learn by tinkering ü§óü•≥ü•≥
## Problem ü§î‚ùì
Many people know maths but how many people know it intuitively. Many people know Eigen vectors, relativity, sorting algorithm and Machine learning Algorithms but how many people have experienced it üòè. How many people can look at a problem and produce effective state of the art solutions to it. Although many people can solve maths few people, few people understance maths intutively, few people realy know what's symbols are all about or what they mean or what they do. Ofcourse we can multiple a vector with a matrix but few people understand what it means or what it's doing, or how it can be applied. Although thiker more encourages the rigorous aspect of any field we also give you experience. Welcome to a world where maths and physics come alive where strange concepts make more sence and they don't look so strange again.

**Welcome to tkiner more**

## About
Tkinker more is an all in environment of many playgrounds each playground is an interactive simulation of some idea, wana learn about vector spaces? Matrices? Artificial Inteligence? Machine Learning Alogorithms? have some weired math concept your are struggling with, tkinker more has all you need to visualize while you learn. You can also experiment your ideas, draw conclusions see how this ideas can be used in real life scenerio. Although tkinkerMore is relatively new we want to implement all these concepts to the maximum extent Say you are learning about matrices you can interact with simple things from matrix addion to the more advance transformation and eigen vectors.

## What do we hope to cover
We hope to cover as much concepts as we can ranging from physics to biology, to economics, to computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, computing algorithms, theoretical physics, quantum physics and lot's more.

#### The future
Tkinker more is a long way from completion, and it's still in it's infancy stage.
So bear with us as we give you a world of infinite posibilities.

We also what users to have a dashboard where they can store personlised experiments they made themselves, draft ideas, make hypothesis and so much more.
